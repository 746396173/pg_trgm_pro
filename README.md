# pg_trgm â€“ text similarity measurement and index searching based on trigrams

## Introduction

The pg_trgm module provides functions and operators for determining the similarity of alphanumeric text based on trigram matching, as well as index operator classes that support fast searching for similar strings.

A trigram is a group of three consecutive characters taken from a string. We can measure the similarity of two strings by counting the number of trigrams they share. This simple idea turns out to be very effective for measuring the similarity of words in many natural languages.

The original module is located in [GitHub](https://github.com/postgres/postgres/tree/master/contrib/pg_trgm). This module provides a new function and new operators which provide fuzzy searching for word in a text.

## License

This module available from [GitHub](https://github.com/postgrespro/pg_trgm_pro) under the same license as [PostgreSQL](http://www.postgresql.org/about/licence/) and supports PostgreSQL 9.4+.

## Installation

Before build and install pg_trgm you should ensure following:

* PostgreSQL version is 9.4 or higher.

Typical installation procedure may look like this:

    $ git clone https://github.com/postgrespro/pg_trgm_pro
    $ cd pg_trgm_pro
    $ make USE_PGXS=1
    $ sudo make USE_PGXS=1 install
    $ make USE_PGXS=1 installcheck
    $ psql DB -c "CREATE EXTENSION pg_trgm;"

## New functions and operators

The pg_trgm module provides the new function.

|          Function           | Returns |                      Description
| --------------------------- | ------- | ---------------------------------------------------
| word_similarity(text, text) | real    | Returns a number that indicates how similar the first string to the most similar word of the second string.  The range of the result is zero (indicating that the two strings are completely dissimilar) to one (indicating that the first string is identical to one of the word of the second string).

The module provides new operators.

|    Operator    | Returns |                      Description
| -------------- | ------- | ---------------------------------------------------
| text %> text   | boolean | Returns **true** if its arguments have a word similarity that is greater than the current word similarity threshold set by **pg_trgm.word_similarity_threshold** parameter.
| text <->> text | real    | Returns the **distance** between the arguments, that is one minus the **word_similarity()** value.

The module provides GUC parameters.

|       Parameter                   | Returns |                      Description
| --------------------------------- | ------- | ---------------------------------------------------
| pg_trgm.similarity_threshold      | real    | Sets the current similarity threshold that is used by the **%** operator. The threshold must be between 0 and 1 (default is 0.3).
| pg_trgm.word_similarity_threshold | real    | Sets the current word similarity threshold that is used by the **%>** operator. The threshold must be between 0 and 1 (default is 0.6).

GiST and GIN indexes support the operator **%>**. The operator **<->>** is supported by the GiST index.

## Examples

Let us assume we have an **test_trgm** table:

```sql
CREATE TABLE test_trgm (t text);
```

You can create GiST index:

```sql
CREATE INDEX trgm_idx ON test_trgm USING GIST (t gist_trgm_ops);
```

or GIN index:

```sql
CREATE INDEX trgm_idx ON test_trgm USING GIN (t gin_trgm_ops);
```

Now you can use an index on the **t** column for word similarity. For example:

```sql
SELECT t, word_similarity('word', t) AS sml
  FROM test_trgm
  WHERE t %> 'word'
  ORDER BY sml DESC, t;
```

This will return all values in the text column that have a word which sufficiently similar to `word`, sorted from best match to worst. The index will be used to make this a fast operation even over very large data sets.

A variant of the above query is:

```sql
SELECT t, t <->> 'word' AS dist
  FROM test_trgm
  ORDER BY dist LIMIT 10;
```

This can be implemented quite efficiently by GiST indexes, but not by GIN indexes.
